# Mockup_MHAflashcards

```
This site was designed in 2019 under the auspices of the MHA Nation Education Department - Culture and Language Division to accompany sets of printed flashcards (also developed by the author) for each of the three MHA language: Mandan, Hidatsda, and Arikara.

The site was intended to host sound files so that users could click on a flashcard image to hear a recording of a fluent speaker pronouncing the word.

The site was never published because of a lack of a reliable server.
